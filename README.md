# LIC (Line Integral Convolution)
This is my project task demonstrating how to implement LIC on a 2D flow with color coding using OpenGL. Here are the required packages
- Qt Framework 5.6+ (including Widgets and GUI)
- CMake 3.4+
- Cg Framework (proprietary, please contact [Computer Graphics Group, University of Siegen](https://www.cg.informatik.uni-siegen.de))

Moreover, the flow data "flow.raw" is needed. This is the data of turbulence over time with the configuration mentioned in the header file as static constant members.
